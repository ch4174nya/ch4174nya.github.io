                      <p> The advent of data analytics and machine learning, coupled with the vast amount of data collected through maritime sensors provided the opportunity and the impetus for Maritime & Port Authority (MPA) to develop a maritime sensemaking system - <u>S</u>ensemaking <u>A</u>nalytics <u>F</u>or maritime <u>E</u>vents <u>R</u>ecognition. The goal was to optimise port operations to meet the existing as well as future demands of the Port of Singapore. The original SAFER proof of concept was established to develop and test-bed new analytics-based technologies to enhance port operations to cater to the increasing growth in vessel traffic in Singapore.
                      <br>
                      This, more recent work of productionizing the Sensemaking system, provides a unified set of capabilities to analyse real time data, understand, and reason through a set of data-driven vessel models, and ultimately to provide consistent situational awareness at MPA. The system empowers maritime officers to make more informed, consistent, and better decisions across MPA departments. Through a common set of machine learning-based models, SAFER detects unusual behaviour of vessels, such as speeding, transponder violations and suspicious co-hangouts. These capabilities help improve port security and safety. 
                      <br>
                      SAFER addresses several areas in maritime management that have historically required significant human effort, from monitoring vessel movements to ensuring safety by detecting unauthorised or illegal behaviour.

                      <p>Recent advances in Machine Learning have made it a go-to suite of techniques for various disciplines. Quantum many-body physics which looks at systems with many fundamental particles at the scale of atoms and below, is one such discipline. The information about the dynamics of such systems is stored in the wave function. However, the number of states of such a system grows exponentially in the number of particles in the system. This makes the study of such systems extremely hard, as they require a large amount of memory to store the entire wavefunction.
                      <br>
                      Carleo and Troyer proposed a framework, neural network quantum states, to solve quantum many-body physics problems using neural networks trained in an unsupervised manner.
                      <br>
                      In this master's thesis, I study the energy of quantum many-body models in two challenging scenarios, the ground state of the Ising J1-J2 model and low-lying excited states for the Ising model.

                    <p>Free speech on the Internet is a political battleground. On one hand, several governments claim that their sovereignty extends to cyberspace, and that they should control the content seen (or written) by their citizens. On the other hand, as censorship is frequently used to silence the opposition, access to free speech online is considered a human right by the United Nations.
                    <br>
                    Decoy Routing, a form of censorship evasion, involves the use of "smart routers" that double as proxies. The client – a resident of a censorious country, who needs to access a blocked site – starts by sending packets addressed to an allowed site (the overt destination). The client's packets are not as innocuous as they seem; they carry covert cryptographic patterns. Once safely past the network boundaries of the censorious country, the packets are seen by a "smart router" – the Decoy Router – which identifies them by the covert pattern they carry. The Decoy Router then hijacks the client's connection and redirects the flow to the covert destination, the real, censored site the client wishes to contact. 
                    <br>
                    In practice, this is not as simple as redirecting a flow as the packets are encrypted using TLS.
                    <br>

                    <p>SiegeBreaker is a Software Defined Network (SDN) based practical, efficient and privacy preserving decoy routing architecture, that has been extensively tested over both emulation setups, as well as testbeds involving commercial SDN switches. In almost all scenarios, SiegeBreaker performs as well as direct TCP connections.

                        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading">Bill of Lading (BL)</a> is a critical document in the ocean freight trade, for it serves three main purposes. It is a conclusive receipt, it contains the terms of the contract of carriage and serves as a document of title to the goods being shipped. Presently, the BL is a physical paper document, issued by the participating shipping line. As the supply chain includes several parties between the shipper and the consignee, the updates on the BL during various stages of the shipment as well as title transfers, take place on the paper and through courier services. 
                        Naturally, this entails document handling costs, losses as well as documentary fraud, leading to trade inefficiency.</p>
                        <p>Digitizing the BL addresses all such inefficiencies and by using a blockchain the lifecycle of the BL, including all issuance, transfer, share and surrender actions on the BL get recorded on a tamperproof ledger. As the BL changes hands, through <i>title transfers</i>, the access controls on the BL data undergo changes. 
                        <br>Additionally, digitizing the BL allows for field level access control, which is not possible in the case of a paper BL. Such a feature is significantly helpful for regulators and other such parties that are only concerned about specific fields or sections of the BL. </p>

                        <br> TradeLens brings together participants as well as the documents onto a single common dashboard, backed by Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain. The system aims to reduce trade barriers, estimating a global GDP increase of at least a trillion US dollars.</p>
